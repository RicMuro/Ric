        <li>Leela Chess Zero is an open-source and deep neural network-based chess engine, led by Gary Linscott; a developer for the Stockfish Chess Engine.
        
        <li>It started with no knowledge about chess, other than the basic rules of the game.
        
        <li>It learns how to play chess by reinforcement learning from playing against itself. It reached a Grandmaster level of play just within a few months of training.
        
        <li>It has played over 500 million games against itself as of January 2022 and plays at a level similar to Stockfish.
